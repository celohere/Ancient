# Ancient
Ancient is a MMORPG server emulator written in C++.  It is free and open-source.

## WARNING
Ancient is a fork of [R3884_SVN](https://github.com/otland/tfs-old-svn/releases/tag/r3884) with last commit in 2010, very legacy. If you want performance and something more modern, it is recommended to use the last stable version of [the forgotten server](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/releases/tag/v1.4) or your [master](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver).

## Getting Started
* 
To connect to the server, you can use [OTClient](https://github.com/edubart/otclient).

## Support
If you need need help, use [issue tracker](https://github.com/ramon-bernardo/Ancient/issues).
